From what I understand anyone is able to see everything we do here. 
Not everyone is able to modify or add anything without permissions but who gives the aproval to change things?
I seen that there is some sort of security policy we can add, it might not be a good idea for everyone to see our work.
I submitted this to further test how it works....
